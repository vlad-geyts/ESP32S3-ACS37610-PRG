**Continue with Phase 3**

Memory is updated. Here is what the new chat will know automatically:

*Carried forward*:

1. Full pin map, protocol spec, all confirmed values (access code, CRC polynomial, ECC behaviour)
2. CRC-3 module is done and tested — no need to revisit
3. RMT TX is the next task, with all the implementation notes (open-drain GPIO, bit encoding, TX→RX turnaround, Core 1 pinning)
4. PlatformIO project structure — lib/ pattern, native test setup, Windows MinGW notes



*What to say when you open the new chat*:

`"Continue with the ACS37610 programmer project. CRC-3 is done. Ready to implement the RMT Manchester TX encoder — please check memory for context."`

That single sentence is enough. The rest will be loaded from memory.


Let me proceed directly with the RMT Manchester TX encoder. This is the most hardware-critical module in Phase 3.

**Update Todos**
1. Create lib/manchester/manchester.h
2. Create lib/manchester/manchester.cpp with RMT TX encoder
3. Update main.cpp to initialise manchester TX in setup()
